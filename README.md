## Overview

The Pipeline Runner is a complete solution for creating, managing, and monitoring scientific workflows. It provides:

- Argo Workflows for pipeline execution and DAG-based workflow management
- Minio object storage for scientific data and results
- Kafka-based event bus for real-time system communication
- Node.js REST API for workflow management
- MongoDB for user and workflow persistent data
- React frontend for user interaction
- Kubernetes-based infrastructure with one-command deployment
- Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and monitoring
- Loki for log aggregation and search
- Thanos for long-term metrics storage

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Infrastructure**

   - Kind local Kubernetes cluster
   - Argo Workflows for workflow execution
   - Kubernetes Dashboard for cluster monitoring
   - Minio for object storage
   - Kafka for event messaging
   - Prometheus for metrics collection and monitoring
   - Grafana for metrics visualization
   - Thanos for long-term metrics storage and querying
   - Loki for log aggregation and querying

2. **Backend**

   - Node.js / Express REST API
   - MongoDB for data persistence
   - Socket.IO for real-time updates

3. **Frontend**
   - React-based user interface
   - Material-UI component library
   - WebSocket connection for real-time updates

## Prerequisites

- Docker (20.10+)
- Kind (0.17+)
- kubectl (1.25+)
- Helm (3.9+)
- Node.js (18+) - for local development only

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:MaryJaneLV/LISA-pipeline-runner-monitoring-dashboard.git
   ```

2. Start the system using the one-command startup script:

   ```
   make start
   ```

3. Once the system is running, you can access:

   - Argo Workflows UI: http://localhost:2746
   - Kubernetes Dashboard: https://localhost:30081 (Access with token printed in the terminal)"
   - Minio Console: http://localhost:30082 (minioadmin/minioadmin)"
   - Mongo Express: http://localhost:9087
   - Kaftdrop: http://localhost:9032
   - Pipeline Runner API: http://localhost:30083
   - Pipeline Runner UI: http://localhost:30084
   - Prometheus UI: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana UI: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
   - Thanos Query UI: http://localhost:10902

4. Register a new user in the Scientific Workflow UI to get started

## Monitoring Infrastructure

The system includes a comprehensive monitoring stack for observability:

### Metrics Collection and Visualization

- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from Kubernetes components, Argo Workflows, and application services
- **Grafana**: Provides pre-configured dashboards for:
  - Main system overview with key metrics
  - Argo Workflows monitoring and performance
  - Kubernetes cluster health and resource usage
  - Historical data analysis and trends
- **Thanos**: Enables long-term metrics storage and querying across multiple Prometheus instances
  - Uses Minio as object storage backend
  - Provides unified query interface for historical data
  - Supports data retention policies and compaction

### Log Aggregation

- **Loki**: Collects and indexes logs from all system components
  - Integrated with Grafana for log visualization
  - Supports log querying and filtering
  - Efficient log storage and retrieval

### Alerting

- **AlertManager**: Allows alerting the responsible engineer of a fail in the system
  - Part of the Prometheus software
  - Use of automated system to alert in case of failure 

### Monitoring Access

- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin) - Main monitoring interface
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090 - Raw metrics exploration
- **Thanos Query**: http://localhost:10902 - Long-term metrics querying

## Development Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Creating Workflows

1. Log in to the Scientific Workflow UI
2. Navigate to "Templates" and create a new template or use an existing one
3. Navigate to "Create Workflow"
4. Select a template and provide the required parameters
5. Submit the workflow

### Script-Based Workflows

The system supports script-based workflows where the processing code is supplied as an input parameter:

1. **Script Inputs**: Users can upload Python, JavaScript, or shell scripts to be executed by workflows
2. **Script Organization**: Scripts are stored in the `/scripts` directory
3. **Docker Support**: Each script can have an accompanying Dockerfile for custom environment setup
4. **Parameter Passing**: Scripts receive parameters via environment variables
5. **Script Storage**: User scripts are stored in Minio and referenced by workflows

#### Example: Number Processing Script Workflow

This workflow accepts a Python script that processes numeric data:

- Takes a script path as input parameter
- Runs the script with specified operation and factor parameters
- Script processes input numbers according to the operation
- Results are stored as CSV files in Minio

#### Example: Simple Dag

This workflow demonstrates a multi-step data processing pipeline:

- Structured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with three sequential steps
- Generate step applies category weights to input data
- Transform step normalizes or transforms the weighted data
- Analyze step produces statistics and visualizations
- All intermediate and final results are stored in Minio
- Each step uses containerized Python scripts with specific requirements

NOTE:

- ALL WORKFLOWS/WORKFLOW TEMPLATE MUST DEFINE A artifactOutputPath PARAMETER
